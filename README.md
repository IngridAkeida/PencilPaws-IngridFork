# PencilPaws Assessment

This is a project/assignment called PencilPaws, which was proposed in the javascript module on Hyper Island. 

In this project, I needed to apply the knowledge acquired to create a dynamic and interactive page as a Brief, this should contain:

- Create a dynamic and interactive web page using JavaScript, including DOM manipulation, event handling, asynchronous data fetching, and data storage.

  Criteria: 
  
  - Use fundamental Javascript concepts such as variables, loops, functions, objects, and arrays
  - Use the DOM API to query, modify, and create elements
  - Use event listeners to add interactivity
  - Use the Web Storage API to persist data
  - Use the Fetch API to get data from a 3rd party
  - Provide a deeper level of understanding and reasoning around topics such as:
    - Writing readable and maintainable code
    - Structuring HTML and querying it with JS in an efficient way
    - Transforming and visualizing data
